ABOUT THE COMPANY Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) is a leader in the environmental services industry. We provide customers with the most complete set of products and services, including recycling, waste, special waste, hazardous waste and field services. Our industry-leading commitments to advance circularity and support decarbonization are helping deliver on our vision to partner with customers to create a more sustainable world. In 2023, Republic’s total company revenue was $14.9 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 billion. We serve 13 million customers and operate more than 1,000 locations, including collection and transfer stations, recycling and polymer centers, treatment facilities, and landfills. Although we operate across North America, the collection, recycling, treatment, or disposal of materials is a local business, and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each market we serve. By combining local operational management with standardized business practices, we drive greater operating efficiencies across the company while maintaining day-to-day operational decisions at the local level, closest to the customer. Our customers, including small businesses, major corporations and municipalities, want a partner with the expertise and capabilities to effectively manage their multiple recycling and waste streams. They choose Republic Services because we are committed to exceeding their expectations and helping them achieve their sustainability goals. Our 41,000 team members understand that it's not just what we do that matters, but how we do it. Our company values guide our daily actions: • Safe: We protect the livelihoods of our colleagues and communities. • Committed to Serve: We go above and beyond to exceed our customers’ expectations. • Environmentally Responsible: We take action to improve our environment. • Driven: We deliver results in the right way. • Human-Centered: We respect the dignity and unique potential of every person. We are proud of our high employee engagement score of 86. We have an inclusive and diverse culture where every voice counts. In addition, our team positively impacted 4.6 million people in 2023 through the Republic Services Charitable Foundation and local community grants. These projects are designed to meet the specific needs of the communities we serve, with a focus on building sustainable neighborhoods. STRATEGY Republic Services’ strategy is designed to generate profitable growth. Through acquisitions and industry advancements, we safely and sustainably manage our customers’ multiple waste streams through a North American footprint of vertically integrated assets. We focus on three areas of growth to meet the increasing needs of our customers: recycling and waste, environmental solutions and sustainability innovation. With our integrated approach, strengthening our position in one area advances other areas of our business. For example, as we grow volume in recycling and waste, we collect additional material to bolster our circularity capabilities. And as we expand environmental solutions, we drive additional opportunities to provide these services to our existing recycling and waste customers. Recycling and Waste We continue to expand our recycling and waste business footprint throughout North America through organic growth and targeted acquisitions. The 13 million customers we serve and our more than 5 million pick-ups per day provide us with a distinct advantage. We aggregate materials at scale, unlocking new opportunities for advanced recycling. In addition, we are cross-selling new products and services to better meet our customers’ specific needs. Environmental Solutions Our comprehensive environmental solutions capabilities help customers safely manage their most technical waste streams. We are expanding both our capabilities and our geographic footprint. We see strong growth opportunities for our offerings, including PFAS remediation, an increasing customer need. SUSTAINABILITY INNOVATION Republic’s recent innovations to advance circularity and decarbonization demonstrate our unique ability to leverage sustainability as a platform for growth. The Republic Services Polymer Center is the nation’s first integrated plastics recycling facility. This innovative site processes rigid plastics from our recycling centers, producing recycled materials that promote true bottle-to-bottle circularity. We also formed Blue Polymers, a joint venture with Ravago, to develop facilities that will further process plastic material from our Polymer Centers to help meet the growing demand for sustainable packaging. We are building a network of Polymer Centers and Blue Polymer facilities across North America. We continue to advance decarbonization at our landfills. As demand for renewable energy continues to grow, we have 70 landfill gas-to-energy projects in operation and plan to expand our portfolio to 115 projects by 2028.

We teach you all you need to know. • Flexible Schedules - Part-time or full-time. You set your schedule day-by-day. • Great Training - Learn how to set goals, manage time, and communicate with skill. • Personal Growth - You'll challenge yourself and stretch your limits. Guaranteed. • Quality Products - Cutco Cutlery is made in America since 1949 and guaranteed FOREVER. What's It Like? So, what's it like to actually be a Cutco representative? While each day is different, daily activities might include: • Scheduling appointments with potential customers • Presenting Cutco products through virtual appointments • Submitting their orders online and through our app • Reviewing sales performance with their manager • Attending an optional weekly Zoom meeting How We Work Our sales representatives meet one-on-one with potential customers through in home or virtual appointments. The sales rep's job is to show Cutco and help those customers find the perfect set that fits their needs. Most people buy, but some don't. And, that's okay. We give our sales reps a guaranteed base pay each time they show Cutco to a qualified potential customer whether the customer buys or not. There's a reason why we pay our reps regardless of sales results. We don't want a sales rep to ever feel pressure to make a sale in any way that's pushy with a customer. We think Cutco is pretty awesome and want customers to buy it because they love it. How can we pay people even if they don't make a sale? Frankly, most people who see Cutco buy something, so we can afford to create this safety net for our reps. Because our reps are independent contractors, they enjoy real flexibility and control over their own schedules. They set their own appointments based on their availability day-by-day. Our sales reps pride themselves in providing ridiculously awesome customer service and enjoy representing a truly incredible (and useful) product. And, it works. Over 15 million homes in North America alone have Cutco in their kitchen. If you’re excited about joining our sales team, fill out the contact form, and a receptionist will reach out to schedule your virtual interview with a manager.",

We build the product, book your appointments, and back you with non-stop marketing—so you can focus on what you do best: delivering exceptional customer experiences and closing high-value deals. Why This Role Stands Out: This is a customer-centric, sales-driven position where you’ll have the opportunity to maximize every interaction—turning standard consultations into high-reward sales opportunities. You'll meet with existing customers either during the pre-construction phase or on the day of install, giving you the chance to present additional products and premium upgrades that elevate their home—and your commissions. What You'll Do: • Conduct in-home consultations with current customers to review orders, walk the property, and uncover upsell opportunities (windows, doors, siding, gutters, and more) • Present tailored product upgrades in a consultative, solution-oriented manner • Set clear expectations to ensure a seamless, high-quality installation experience • Collect signatures and payments for addendums when applicable • Represent the Thompson Creek brand with professionalism and integrity—building rapport, earning referrals, and cultivating lifelong customers • Occasionally support hyper-local marketing efforts around active project sites If you're driven by results, thrive on customer interaction, and are ready to turn every appointment into a sales win—we’d love to meet you.

    "job_description": "Meet Upside: We created Upside to transform brick-and-mortar commerce. Our technology uses the sophistication of online retail—profit measurement, attribution, and incrementality—to provide users with more value on their everyday purchases and brick-and-mortar businesses with new, profitable customers. We’ve helped millions of users earn 2 to 3 times more cashback than any other product, and hundreds of thousands of brick-and-mortar businesses earn measurable profit. Billions of dollars in commerce run through the Upside platform every year, and that value goes directly back to our retailer partners, the consumers they serve, and important sustainability initiatives. About the role: We're looking for an Analytics Engineer to join the team responsible for Upside’s core data platform. You’ll play a key role in building trusted data products that serve both internal teams and customer-facing features, while also improving the analytics platform and enabling others to do their best data work. This is a great opportunity for someone who’s confident working with large datasets and complex business logic, thrives in a fast-moving environment, and wants to grow as a technical contributor while collaborating closely with product managers, analysts, data scientists, and engineers across the company. Here are some ways we have seen analytics engineers drive impact at Upside: • Design and build complex, scalable data products that support internal analytics and power product features, using tools like dbt, Snowflake, and Dagster. • Translate ambiguous business needs into structured, trustworthy data assets—owning development end-to-end, from design through deployment and monitoring. • Contribute to shared platform tooling that improves pipeline orchestration, testing, access control, and observability for both engineers and analysts. • Evaluate and implement new platform capabilities, such as Semantic Views, Cortex, or SnowML, to improve performance, maintainability, and user experience. • Support and enable teammates across the org, including onboarding new users, resolving data issues, and documenting patterns and best practices. • Maintain reliability and data quality through shield support rotations, strong monitoring, alerting, and test coverage. Why You Should Apply This role is a good fit for you if: • You aren’t afraid to challenge the status quo when it makes the team and business better. You learn from those around you while utilizing data to advocate for informed change. • You thrive at the intersection of systems and storytelling, not only building robust solutions but also communicating their purpose, impact and rationale, so teams can experiment, iterate, and act confidently. • You care about building resilient systems that scale. You bring a mindset of continuous improvement, and know when to invest in observability, automation, or new infrastructure to reduce toil and improve outcomes for the team and end users. • You believe that pulling quality upstream starts with engineering. You champion best practices, encourage early testing and validation, and work closely with peers to build a culture of quality from the ground up. Ideal Qualifications • Have 2+ years of experience working in data or analytics engineering roles, preferably in a modern data stack environment (e.g., Snowflake, dbt, Dagster, Airflow). • Are fluent in SQL, and comfortable writing performant, modular transformations at scale. • Have working knowledge of Python, particularly in the context of data orchestration, transformations, and testing. • Understand tradeoffs between different modeling approaches (e.g., Kimball vs. OBT), and can choose appropriate techniques based on data volume and business needs. • Can independently communicate technical concepts to both engineers and non-technical stakeholders. • Think critically about ROI, know when to automate, and understand how to balance long-term quality with short-term delivery. Preferred Qualifications • Experience supporting machine learning workflows, such as building features or monitoring model inputs and outputs. • Familiarity with DevOps practices (e.g., CI/CD for data), data governance, or FinOps (cost-conscious design). • Experience working in a fast-growing startup environment or on platform-style teams that serve internal customers. Engineering Culture: We want our engineers to have the time and support to grow in their craft and contribute meaningfully to impactful technical decisions. Engineers are encouraged to focus deeply on their work, collaborate effectively with team members, and continuously develop their skills. Teams are thoughtfully staffed to create a dynamic and diverse environment that enhances learning and innovation. Location: This hybrid role is based in our Austin, Chicago, DC, or NYC office.

Who You Are: You’re a builder and operator who thrives in fast-moving, high-accountability environments. You take pride in getting things done — thoughtfully, efficiently, and without drama. You’re energized by ambiguity, skilled at bringing clarity, and comfortable flexing between strategy and execution. You value feedback — giving it, receiving it, and acting on it — and you see collaboration as a competitive advantage, not a burden. You’re low-ego but high-agency: you care about winning as a team more than being right individually. You move quickly, communicate directly, and make decisions grounded in impact and data. You don’t need constant direction — you create momentum. You take ownership for outcomes, and you expect the same from those around you. How We Operate: We move fast, work smart, and hold ourselves to a high bar. Axion isn’t a 9–5 — it’s a place for people who take pride in their craft and are motivated by meaningful work.

We move quickly, share feedback often, and keep discussions open so decisions and context flow freely. If you value crisp communication, rapid iteration, and a steady hum of collaboration, you’ll fit right in. We: • Collaborate deeply.

Everyone is accountable for outcomes, not just tasks. • Sustain excellence. We push hard but don’t glorify burnout — we’re in this for the long game. If you want to help shape a company redefining how manufacturing operates — and you thrive in a culture that rewards ownership, speed, and candor — you’ll feel at home here What We Offer: • Work with cutting-edge AI technology making a tangible impact in manufacturing • Collaborative, mission-driven team and supportive leadership • Generous time off • Competitive compensation, equity, and benefits • Lunch stipend….

WHO WE ARE We believe in creating a unique & rewarding work experience for our people. Our people are hard-working, have a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. Who Are We? We're the company that sells Cutco Cutlery. Our people are diverse and fun (a great number of our sales force is college-aged) and they love representing our world-class kitchen cutlery. True, many of the people we work with never once thought about kitchen knives before they met us. But, they catch on quickly. What's Vector? Vector Marketing is a single-level direct sales company that sells Cutco®. Early in Cutco Corporation's history, there were hundreds of small independent sellers of Cutco®. In 1981, Vector Marketing was founded to be one of those independent sellers. From 1981 to 1984 Vector sold way more than all the other independent sellers. In 1985, Cutco Corporation (back then it was called Alcas Corporation) bought the company from its owners to replicate Vector's success across the nation. Now, Vector Marketing is the primary seller of Cutco Cutlery. Our home office is in Olean, New York, and we have over 250 year-round, independently run locations throughout the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. Plus, we have over 300 more temporary locations that open each year for our peak summer season. What's Cutco? We're glad you asked! Cutco Cutlery is a high-quality line of kitchen cutlery, kitchen accessories, and sporting knives. Cutco has been manufactured in Olean, New York since 1949. (That's right: we are proud to be the only high-quality cutlery line still made right here in the USA.) Over 15 million homes in North America have Cutco in their kitchen. Why? Because the knives are awesome... and guaranteed FOREVER. Our customers absolutely love them. What We Believe We believe that in order to succeed as a company, we first have to help individual people succeed. We believe that treating someone on our team as an individual is better than applying a cookie cutter management style to someone's personality. Our goal is to provide an exceptional work environment so our people can give our customers great customer service. We're Proud Because... We're one of the largest recruiters of college students in North America each year. • Our people develop some sweet skills while selling Cutco, and they build a resume that can take them anywhere. • Our people think it's pretty cool to give back. • Our people are diverse. If you're willing to work hard, have an open mind and a great attitude, we might be a good fit for you! How We Do Business We belong to the Direct Selling Association, which is the national trade association for companies who manufacture and distribute goods and services sold directly to consumers. All DSA members follow a strict Code of Ethics. Here's what that means for you: We think that professionalism, integrity, and ethical business practices matter.

WHO WE ARE We believe in creating a unique & rewarding work experience for our people. Our people are hard-working, have a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. Who Are We? We're the company that sells Cutco Cutlery. Our people are diverse and fun (a great number of our sales force is college-aged) and they love representing our world-class kitchen cutlery. True, many of the people we work with never once thought about kitchen knives before they met us. But, they catch on quickly. What's Vector? Vector Marketing is a single-level direct sales company that sells Cutco®. Early in Cutco Corporation's history, there were hundreds of small independent sellers of Cutco®. In 1981, Vector Marketing was founded to be one of those independent sellers. From 1981 to 1984 Vector sold way more than all the other independent sellers. In 1985, Cutco Corporation (back then it was called Alcas Corporation) bought the company from its owners to replicate Vector's success across the nation. Now, Vector Marketing is the primary seller of Cutco Cutlery. Our home office is in Olean, New York, and we have over 250 year-round, independently run locations throughout the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. Plus, we have over 300 more temporary locations that open each year for our peak summer season. What's Cutco? We're glad you asked! Cutco Cutlery is a high-quality line of kitchen cutlery, kitchen accessories, and sporting knives. Cutco has been manufactured in Olean, New York since 1949. (That's right: we are proud to be the only high-quality cutlery line still made right here in the USA.) Over 15 million homes in North America have Cutco in their kitchen. Why? Because the knives are awesome... and guaranteed FOREVER. Our customers absolutely love them. What We Believe We believe that in order to succeed as a company, we first have to help individual people succeed. We believe that treating someone on our team as an individual is better than applying a cookie cutter management style to someone's personality. Our goal is to provide an exceptional work environment so our people can give our customers great customer service. We're Proud Because... We're one of the largest recruiters of college students in North America each year. • Our people develop some sweet skills while selling Cutco, and they build a resume that can take them anywhere. • Our people think it's pretty cool to give back. • Our people are diverse. If you're willing to work hard, have an open mind and a great attitude, we might be a good fit for you! How We Do Business We belong to the Direct Selling Association, which is the national trade association for companies who manufacture and distribute goods and services sold directly to consumers. All DSA members follow a strict Code of Ethics. Here's what that means for you: We think that professionalism, integrity, and ethical business practices matter. Frankly, we think that's the only way to do business.
