Your job is to make sure the world sees that beauty first.\n\nWe’re looking for a Senior Amazon Brand Designer to elevate how Hadley Designs shows up in search results, on Amazon, and across digital storefronts. This is a hands-on creative role for someone who can turn data and visuals into results, someone who understands that the right image can make a parent stop scrolling and start believing.\n\nThat’s where you come in.\n\nAbout Hadley Designs\n\nHadley Designs is a family-founded, female-led brand redefining early education through creativity, beauty, and connection.

We believe that beautiful design creates better learning and that childhood should be filled with wonder, not screens.\n\nAbout The Role\n\nAs our Senior Amazon Brand Designer, you’ll lead how Hadley Designs visually shows up on Amazon and other e-commerce platforms. You won’t be designing the products themselves, you’ll be designing how those products are seen.\n\nFrom main images to A+ content and storefront layouts, you’ll create visual experiences that win the click, tell our story, and consistently outperform last year’s results. You’ll combine your eye for beauty with a mind for analytics, ensuring every visual element connects emotionally while driving measurable growth.\n\nYour Core Focus\n• Own the design strategy for all product imagery and listing visuals on Amazon.\n• Execute and analyze A/B tests to optimize main and secondary images.\n• Maintain click-through rates higher than the same month last year for each category.\n• Develop consistent visual systems, templates, and guidelines that reinforce brand trust.\n• Partner with sales and product teams to align creative output with performance goals.\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n• Design, test, and optimize imagery for Amazon product listings and A+ content.\n• Create clear, on-brand visual stories that differentiate Hadley Designs in crowded search results.\n• Use data insights to make creative decisions and report on performance improvements.\n• Maintain an organized image library and workflow documentation.\n• Collaborate with copywriters and category leads to ensure visuals and messaging align.\n• Lead creative reviews, coaching team members on layout, lighting, and storytelling.\n• Stay up to date on e-commerce trends, competitor visuals, and Amazon content innovations.\n\nHow Success Is Measured\n• Year-over-year CTR growth across categories.\n• Visual consistency and accuracy across all listings.\n• Creative team satisfaction score ≥ 8/10.\n• Zero errors in A+ content or Storefront execution.\n\nWho You Are\n\nYou’re a creative strategist who understands the art and science of visual performance. You love transforming data into design direction and know how to make a brand stand out in a sea of sameness. You care deeply about excellence, every image, layout, and decision reflects that.\n\nRequirements\n• 5+ years of graphic design experience (including at least 2 in e-commerce).\n• Proven track record of improving CTR or conversions through visual optimization.\n• Advanced proficiency in Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator).\n• Expertise in Amazon image strategy and A/B testing tools (PickFu, Helium 10, Amazon Experiments).\n• Strong understanding of composition, lighting, and visual hierarchy.\n• Highly organized, detail-oriented, and process-driven.\n• Excellent communicator who thrives in collaboration and feedback.\n• Growth-minded creative who combines beauty, data, and discipline.\n\nYou’re not designing products, you’re designing perception. You’re the creative mind that helps families see the value, quality, and joy behind every Hadley Designs product.\n\nBenefits\n\nWhy You’ll Love Working Here\n\nHadley Designs is a remote-first company built on trust, creativity, and autonomy. We’re a small but mighty team that believes in balancing excellence with flexibility. You’ll work directly with our founders, influence how millions of families experience our brand, and see your creative impact reflected in real results.\n\nYou’ll Enjoy\n• A remote-first environment with flexible hours.\n• Paid time off and holidays.\n• Ongoing creative training and professional development.\n• Free access to Hadley Designs products.\n• Regular collaboration with leadership, including our CEO and CCO.\n• A decade of brand growth and family-rooted purpose.\n\nAt Hadley Designs, your creativity helps shape how the world experiences learning—one image, one family, one smile at a time.\n\nApply Today\n\nJoin us in shaping the future of joyful, screen-free learning.\n\nApply today and help us make learning fun, engaging, and screen-free for families everywhere.",

Our 41,000 team members understand that it's not just what we do that matters, but how we do it.\n\nOur company values guide our daily actions:\n• Safe: We protect the livelihoods of our colleagues and communities.\n• Committed to Serve: We go above and beyond to exceed our customers’ expectations.\n• Environmentally Responsible: We take action to improve our environment.\n• Driven: We deliver results in the right way.\n• Human-Centered: We respect the dignity and unique potential of every person.\n\nWe are proud of our high employee engagement score of 86. We have an inclusive and diverse culture where every voice counts. In addition, our team positively impacted 4.6 million people in 2023 through the Republic Services Charitable Foundation and local community grants. These projects are designed to meet the specific needs of the communities we serve, with a focus on building sustainable neighborhoods.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nRepublic Services’ strategy is designed to generate profitable growth. Through acquisitions and industry advancements, we safely and sustainably manage our customers’ multiple waste streams through a North American footprint of vertically integrated assets.\n\nWe focus on three areas of growth to meet the increasing needs of our customers: recycling and waste, environmental solutions and sustainability innovation.\n\nWith our integrated approach, strengthening our position in one area advances other areas of our business. For example, as we grow volume in recycling and waste, we collect additional material to bolster our circularity capabilities. And as we expand environmental solutions, we drive additional opportunities to provide these services to our existing recycling and waste customers.\n\nRecycling and Waste\n\nWe continue to expand our recycling and waste business footprint throughout North America through organic growth and targeted acquisitions. The 13 million customers we serve and our more than 5 million pick-ups per day provide us with a distinct advantage. We aggregate materials at scale, unlocking new opportunities for advanced recycling. In addition, we are cross-selling new products and services to better meet our customers’ specific needs.\n\nEnvironmental Solutions\n\nOur comprehensive environmental solutions capabilities help customers safely manage their most technical waste streams. We are expanding both our capabilities and our geographic footprint. We see strong growth opportunities for our offerings, including PFAS remediation, an increasing customer need.\n\nSUSTAINABILITY INNOVATION\n\nRepublic’s recent innovations to advance circularity and decarbonization demonstrate our unique ability to leverage sustainability as a platform for growth.\n\nThe Republic Services Polymer Center is the nation’s first integrated plastics recycling facility. This innovative site processes rigid plastics from our recycling centers, producing recycled materials that promote true bottle-to-bottle circularity. We also formed Blue Polymers, a joint venture with Ravago, to develop facilities that will further process plastic material from our Polymer Centers to help meet the growing demand for sustainable packaging. We are building a network of Polymer Centers and Blue Polymer facilities across North America.\n\nWe continue to advance decarbonization at our landfills. As demand for renewable energy continues to grow, we have 70 landfill gas-to-energy projects in operation and plan to expand our portfolio to 115 projects by 2028.\n\nRECENT RECOGNITION\n• Barron’s 100 Most Sustainable Companies\n• CDP Discloser\n• Dow Jones Sustainability Indices\n• Ethisphere’s World’s Most Ethical Companies\n• Fortune World’s Most Admired Companies\n• Great Place to Work\n• Sustainability Yearbook S&P Global",

We think Cutco is pretty awesome and want customers to buy it because they love it.\n\nHow can we pay people even if they don't make a sale? Frankly, most people who see Cutco buy something, so we can afford to create this safety net for our reps.\n\nBecause our reps are independent contractors, they enjoy real flexibility and control over their own schedules. They set their own appointments based on their availability day-by-day.\n\nOur sales reps pride themselves in providing ridiculously awesome customer service and enjoy representing a truly incredible (and useful) product.\n\nAnd, it works. Over 15 million homes in North America alone have Cutco in their kitchen.\n\nIf you’re excited about joining our sales team, fill out the contact form, and a receptionist will reach out to schedule your virtual interview with a manager.",

    "job_description": "Meet Upside:\n\nWe created Upside to transform brick-and-mortar commerce. Our technology uses the sophistication of online retail—profit measurement, attribution, and incrementality—to provide users with more value on their everyday purchases and brick-and-mortar businesses with new, profitable customers. We’ve helped millions of users earn 2 to 3 times more cashback than any other product, and hundreds of thousands of brick-and-mortar businesses earn measurable profit. Billions of dollars in commerce run through the Upside platform every year, and that value goes directly back to our retailer partners, the consumers they serve, and important sustainability initiatives.\n\nAbout the role:\n\nWe're looking for an Analytics Engineer to join the team responsible for Upside’s core data platform. You’ll play a key role in building trusted data products that serve both internal teams and customer-facing features, while also improving the analytics platform and enabling others to do their best data work.\n\nThis is a great opportunity for someone who’s confident working with large datasets and complex business logic, thrives in a fast-moving environment, and wants to grow as a technical contributor while collaborating closely with product managers, analysts, data scientists, and engineers across the company.\n\nHere are some ways we have seen analytics engineers drive impact at Upside:\n• Design and build complex, scalable data products that support internal analytics and power product features, using tools like dbt, Snowflake, and Dagster.\n• Translate ambiguous business needs into structured, trustworthy data assets—owning development end-to-end, from design through deployment and monitoring.\n• Contribute to shared platform tooling that improves pipeline orchestration, testing, access control, and observability for both engineers and analysts.\n• Evaluate and implement new platform capabilities, such as Semantic Views, Cortex, or SnowML, to improve performance, maintainability, and user experience.\n• Support and enable teammates across the org, including onboarding new users, resolving data issues, and documenting patterns and best practices.\n• Maintain reliability and data quality through shield support rotations, strong monitoring, alerting, and test coverage.\n\nWhy You Should Apply\n\nThis role is a good fit for you if:\n• You aren’t afraid to challenge the status quo when it makes the team and business better. You learn from those around you while utilizing data to advocate for informed change.\n• You thrive at the intersection of systems and storytelling, not only building robust solutions but also communicating their purpose, impact and rationale, so teams can experiment, iterate, and act confidently.\n• You care about building resilient systems that scale. You bring a mindset of continuous improvement, and know when to invest in observability, automation, or new infrastructure to reduce toil and improve outcomes for the team and end users.\n• You believe that pulling quality upstream starts with engineering. You champion best practices, encourage early testing and validation, and work closely with peers to build a culture of quality from the ground up.\n\nIdeal Qualifications\n• Have 2+ years of experience working in data or analytics engineering roles, preferably in a modern data stack environment (e.g., Snowflake, dbt, Dagster, Airflow).\n• Are fluent in SQL, and comfortable writing performant, modular transformations at scale.\n• Have working knowledge of Python, particularly in the context of data orchestration, transformations, and testing.\n• Understand tradeoffs between different modeling approaches (e.g., Kimball vs. OBT), and can choose appropriate techniques based on data volume and business needs.\n• Can independently communicate technical concepts to both engineers and non-technical stakeholders.\n• Think critically about ROI, know when to automate, and understand how to balance long-term quality with short-term delivery.\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n• Experience supporting machine learning workflows, such as building features or monitoring model inputs and outputs.\n• Familiarity with DevOps practices (e.g., CI/CD for data), data governance, or FinOps (cost-conscious design).\n• Experience working in a fast-growing startup environment or on platform-style teams that serve internal customers.\n\nEngineering Culture:\n\nWe want our engineers to have the time and support to grow in their craft and contribute meaningfully to impactful technical decisions. Engineers are encouraged to focus deeply on their work, collaborate effectively with team members, and continuously develop their skills. Teams are thoughtfully staffed to create a dynamic and diverse environment that enhances learning and innovation.\n\nLocation:\n\nThis hybrid role is based in our Austin, Chicago, DC, or NYC office. In-office attendance is required on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday and may increase based on project-based needs and changes to Upside’s in-office policy over time.\n\nCompensation:\n\nThe US base salary range for this full-time position is $130,000 - $180,000 + equity + benefits. The final starting pay will be determined based on job-related skills, experience, qualifications, work location, and market conditions. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range during the hiring process.\n\n#LI-Hybrid\n\n#LI-NE1\n\nBenefits:\n• Medical, dental, and vision coverage starting on Day 1\n• Equity (ISOs)\n• 401(k) program\n• Family planning programs + paid parental leave\n• Physical fitness and wellness memberships\n• Emotional and mental health support programs\n• Unlimited PTO + 10 paid federal holidays + our annual, week-long Winter Break\n• Flexible work environment\n• Lunch reimbursement for in-office employees\n• Employee Resource Groups\n• Learning and Development stipend\n• Transparent culture\n• Amazing mission!\n\nDiversity and Inclusion:\n\nDiversity drives innovation, and our differences make us stronger. We‘re passionate about building a workplace that represents a variety of backgrounds, skills, and perspectives, and we do not discriminate based on race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

    "job_description": "About Us:\n\nFounded in 2021, Axion is at the forefront of transforming product quality and customer satisfaction in manufacturing. Our cutting-edge AI-powered platform empowers manufacturers to swiftly identify, thoroughly investigate, and effectively resolve quality issues while simultaneously elevating customer experiences and outcomes.\n\nAs trailblazers in end-to-end quality intelligence, we're setting new industry standards. Our innovative approach enables industrial, aerospace, consumer, and medtech manufacturers to harness the power of quality and post-market data, driving down costs and boosting business performance.\n\nOur vision extends beyond mere problem-solving; we're committed to reshaping the future of manufacturing. By seamlessly integrating advanced AI technology with deep industry expertise, Axion is paving the way for smarter, safer, and more efficient production processes across diverse sectors.\n\nBacked by leading investors, including Bessemer Venture Partners, Amplo, Boeing, and RTX Ventures, Axion is poised to lead the quality revolution in manufacturing.\n\nAbout the Role:\n\nWe are seeking a Data Operations Lead to own the performance, structure, and scalability of Axion’s global data operations.\n\nThis is a highly cross-functional, strategic role at the intersection of data excellence and operational leadership. The ideal candidate blends the structured problem-solving and analytical rigor of top-tier consulting with the executional drive and adaptability of a startup operator.\n\nYou’ll be responsible for setting the vision and operational rhythm for Axion’s data organization, ensuring quality, efficiency, and alignment with the broader business.\n\nKey Responsibilities:\n• Lead Global Data Operations: Oversee and scale a data operations team based in India, ensuring quality, throughput, and accountability across projects.\n• Build Systems & Processes: Design and implement data workflows, reporting frameworks, and SLAs that enable consistent, high-quality delivery at scale.\n• Bridge Data & Business: Translate business objectives into operational KPIs and data requirements; partner closely with Product, Engineering, and Solutions teams to align on priorities.\n• Operational Analytics: Build visibility into productivity, error rates, and efficiency — using dashboards, root-cause analyses, and continuous improvement frameworks.\n• Leadership Development: Mentor and grow team leads in India to build a high-performance management layer; foster a culture of ownership, clarity, and speed.\n• Cross-Border Execution: Act as the connective tissue between U.S. leadership and India-based operations — ensuring communication, governance, and alignment.\n• Strategic Projects: Lead special initiatives related to data quality, automation, and vendor optimization to drive operational leverage and margin improvement.\n\nRequirements:\n• 6+ years of experience across data operations, business operations, or strategy, ideally within high-growth tech or AI-driven environments.\n• Background in top-tier management consulting (McKinsey, Bain, or BCG) and/or startup operations with a track record of scaling complex systems.\n• Experience managing large distributed or offshore teams (50+ people, ideally India-based).\n• Strong analytical and quantitative mindset, comfortable with dashboards, KPIs, and process optimization.\n• Deep understanding of data workflows (collection, labeling, QA) and tooling (e.g., Labelbox, Scale, AWS, or custom pipelines).\n• Proven ability to operate autonomously, influence cross-functional stakeholders, and drive clarity amid ambiguity.\n• Excellent written and verbal communication skills; able to engage confidently with executives and technical leaders.\n\nWho You Are:\n\nYou’re a builder and operator who thrives in fast-moving, high-accountability environments. You take pride in getting things done — thoughtfully, efficiently, and without drama. You’re energized by ambiguity, skilled at bringing clarity, and comfortable flexing between strategy and execution.\n\nYou value feedback — giving it, receiving it, and acting on it — and you see collaboration as a competitive advantage, not a burden. You’re low-ego but high-agency: you care about winning as a team more than being right individually. You move quickly, communicate directly, and make decisions grounded in impact and data.\n\nYou don’t need constant direction — you create momentum. You take ownership for outcomes, and you expect the same from those around you.\n\nHow We Operate:\n\nWe move fast, work smart, and hold ourselves to a high bar. Axion isn’t a 9–5 — it’s a place for people who take pride in their craft and are motivated by meaningful work. We respect time off and boundaries, but we’re also realistic: hard problems sometimes require weekend pushes or late-night thinking sessions. We support that balance — intensity with respect for recharge.\n\nWe stay highly collaborative and connected throughout the day — much of our communication happens over Slack. We move quickly, share feedback often, and keep discussions open so decisions and context flow freely. If you value crisp communication, rapid iteration, and a steady hum of collaboration, you’ll fit right in.\n\nWe:\n• Collaborate deeply. Feedback is part of how we build — everyone has a voice, and ideas win on merit.\n• Leave ego at the door. Titles don’t define value; contribution does.\n• Bias toward action. We iterate fast and favor progress over perfection.\n• Communicate with clarity. Direct, transparent, and always in service of the mission.\n• Act like owners. Everyone is accountable for outcomes, not just tasks.\n• Sustain excellence. We push hard but don’t glorify burnout — we’re in this for the long game.\n\nIf you want to help shape a company redefining how manufacturing operates — and you thrive in a culture that rewards ownership, speed, and candor — you’ll feel at home here\n\nWhat We Offer:\n• Work with cutting-edge AI technology making a tangible impact in manufacturing\n• Collaborative, mission-driven team and supportive leadership\n• Generous time off\n• Competitive compensation, equity, and benefits\n• Lunch stipend…. And much more\n\nReady to drive the future of manufacturing with AI? Apply today to join our team and help us build the category-defining platform for quality intelligence.\n\nAxion is an Equal Opportunity / Affirmative Action employer committed to diversity in the workplace.

    "job_description": "Vector Marketing is currently scheduling interviews for part-time sales representatives. Our sales representatives focus on customer service and meet with customers in low-pressure, one-on-one appointments to sell Cutco products. We offer a minimum base pay so representatives can focus on providing excellent service rather than feeling pressured to make sales. We believe the quality of our products speaks for itself. Apply today to interview within the week.\n\nWhat We Offer:\n\nCommissions are available based on individual performance. Representatives have the opportunity to earn more while still receiving pay during weeks when sales are lower. Weekly pay is issued as either base pay or commission, whichever is higher.\n\nWe offer thorough training before representatives begin working, along with ongoing support and additional training as experience is gained.\n\nOur product line includes Cutco kitchen products and select gardening tools. No prior product knowledge or sales experience is required.\n\nRepresentatives can set their own weekly schedules to work around holidays, internships, school, exams, full-time jobs, or family commitments.\n\nAfter training, representatives work locally. All meetings and training sessions are conducted in the office.\n\nThere are opportunities to advance into long-term sales positions or management roles, even for those who start in part-time positions.\n\nWhat We Require:\n\nEnjoy interacting with people\nMust be at least 17 or 18 years old and a high school graduate\nConditions apply\nWilling to learn and use new skills\nAble to interview within the next 5 to 7 days\n\nWhat Makes a Good Candidate:\n\nThis entry-level position is well suited for individuals seeking to add income alongside an existing job. Whether you work as a receptionist, cashier, server, in fast food, or retail, our flexible scheduling can fit your availability. Students looking for winter break work or individuals needing flexible hours are encouraged to apply. Degree requirements are not necessary, as full training is provided. We welcome applicants of all ages and experience levels.\n\nSuccessful representatives often have experience in customer service, warehouse roles, food service, administrative work, retail, or communications.\n\nOur training is structured to support people from all work backgrounds, meaning those with experience as baristas, line cooks, cashiers, or stockers can perform well in this role.\n\nWHO WE ARE\n\nWe believe in creating a unique & rewarding work experience for our people.\n\nOur people are hard-working, have a positive attitude and a willingness to learn.\n\nWho Are We?\n\nWe're the company that sells Cutco Cutlery. Our people are diverse and fun (a great number of our sales force is college-aged) and they love representing our world-class kitchen cutlery.\n\nTrue, many of the people we work with never once thought about kitchen knives before they met us. But, they catch on quickly.\n\nWhat's Vector?\n\nVector Marketing is a single-level direct sales company that sells Cutco®.\n\nEarly in Cutco Corporation's history, there were hundreds of small independent sellers of Cutco®. In 1981, Vector Marketing was founded to be one of those independent sellers. From 1981 to 1984 Vector sold way more than all the other independent sellers.\n\nIn 1985, Cutco Corporation (back then it was called Alcas Corporation) bought the company from its owners to replicate Vector's success across the nation.\n\nNow, Vector Marketing is the primary seller of Cutco Cutlery.\n\nOur home office is in Olean, New York, and we have over 250 year-round, independently run locations throughout the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. Plus, we have over 300 more temporary locations that open each year for our peak summer season.\n\nWhat's Cutco?\n\nWe're glad you asked!\n\nCutco Cutlery is a high-quality line of kitchen cutlery, kitchen accessories, and sporting knives. Cutco has been manufactured in Olean, New York since 1949.\n\n(That's right: we are proud to be the only high-quality cutlery line still made right here in the USA.)\n\nOver 15 million homes in North America have Cutco in their kitchen. Why? Because the knives are awesome... and guaranteed FOREVER. Our customers absolutely love them.\n\nWhat We Believe\n\nWe believe that in order to succeed as a company, we first have to help individual people succeed.\n\nWe believe that treating someone on our team as an individual is better than applying a cookie cutter management style to someone's personality.\n\nOur goal is to provide an exceptional work environment so our people can give our customers great customer service.\n\nWe're Proud Because...\n\nWe're one of the largest recruiters of college students in North America each year.\n• Our people develop some sweet skills while selling Cutco, and they build a resume that can take them anywhere.\n• Our people think it's pretty cool to give back.\n• Our people are diverse.\n\nIf you're willing to work hard, have an open mind and a great attitude, we might be a good fit for you!\n\nHow We Do Business\n\nWe belong to the Direct Selling Association, which is the national trade association for companies who manufacture and distribute goods and services sold directly to consumers. All DSA members follow a strict Code of Ethics.\n\nHere's what that means for you:\n\nWe think that professionalism, integrity, and ethical business practices matter.\n\nFrankly, we think that's the only way to do business.\n\nIf you believe this opportunity is right for you, complete the contact form and a receptionist will contact you by text to arrange an interview with a manager.",

    "job_description": "Vector Marketing is currently conducting interviews for part-time sales representatives. Our customer service-driven sales reps engage with customers through low-pressure, one-on-one appointments, where they sell Cutco products. We offer a guaranteed minimum base pay, allowing our reps to focus on delivering excellent service rather than feeling pressured to make sales. We believe the quality of our products speaks for itself. Apply today and secure an interview within the week!\n\nWhat We Offer:\n• Performance-based commissions: Reps have the chance to earn more based on performance, but even if sales are slow, they will still receive pay. Reps are paid weekly, with pay being the higher of base salary or commission.\n• Comprehensive training: We provide thorough training to ensure our reps are fully prepared for the role before they start, along with ongoing support and additional training over time.\n• Product line: We sell Cutco kitchen products and some gardening tools. No prior knowledge of these products or sales experience is required.\n• Flexible schedule: Reps have the freedom to set their own weekly schedule, accommodating holidays, internships, school commitments, finals, full-time jobs, or family responsibilities.\n• Local work opportunities: After completing training, reps will work within their local area. Meetings and training are held at our office.\n• Advancement potential: Reps have the opportunity to move into long-term sales positions or management roles, even if they start part-time.\n\nWhat We Require:\n• Enjoy interacting with people\n• Must be at least 17 or 18 years old and a high school graduate\n• Willingness to learn and apply new skills\n• Available for an interview within the next 5 to 7 days\n• Some conditions apply\n\nWhat Makes a Good Candidate:\n\nThis entry-level position is ideal for individuals seeking to supplement their current work schedule. Whether you work as a receptionist, cashier, in food service, retail, or another field, we offer flexible hours that can fit around your other commitments. If you’re a student looking for winter break work or someone in need of a flexible schedule, our opportunities will accommodate your needs. Whether you have a Bachelor's degree, an Associate’s degree, or no degree at all, we provide the necessary training to ensure success. We encourage applicants from all age groups and backgrounds, as we do not discriminate based on age.\n\nSuccessful candidates come from a variety of fields, including customer service, warehouse stocking, food service, administration, retail, and more. Our training is comprehensive enough to ensure that even those with experience as baristas, line cooks, cashiers, or stockers can succeed.\n\nWHO WE ARE\n\nWe believe in creating a unique & rewarding work experience for our people.\n\nOur people are hard-working, have a positive attitude and a willingness to learn.\n\nWho Are We?\n\nWe're the company that sells Cutco Cutlery. Our people are diverse and fun (a great number of our sales force is college-aged) and they love representing our world-class kitchen cutlery.\n\nTrue, many of the people we work with never once thought about kitchen knives before they met us. But, they catch on quickly.\n\nWhat's Vector?\n\nVector Marketing is a single-level direct sales company that sells Cutco®.\n\nEarly in Cutco Corporation's history, there were hundreds of small independent sellers of Cutco®. In 1981, Vector Marketing was founded to be one of those independent sellers. From 1981 to 1984 Vector sold way more than all the other independent sellers.\n\nIn 1985, Cutco Corporation (back then it was called Alcas Corporation) bought the company from its owners to replicate Vector's success across the nation.\n\nNow, Vector Marketing is the primary seller of Cutco Cutlery.\n\nOur home office is in Olean, New York, and we have over 250 year-round, independently run locations throughout the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. Plus, we have over 300 more temporary locations that open each year for our peak summer season.\n\nWhat's Cutco?\n\nWe're glad you asked!\n\nCutco Cutlery is a high-quality line of kitchen cutlery, kitchen accessories, and sporting knives. Cutco has been manufactured in Olean, New York since 1949.\n\n(That's right: we are proud to be the only high-quality cutlery line still made right here in the USA.)\n\nOver 15 million homes in North America have Cutco in their kitchen. Why? Because the knives are awesome... and guaranteed FOREVER. Our customers absolutely love them.\n\nWhat We Believe\n\nWe believe that in order to succeed as a company, we first have to help individual people succeed.\n\nWe believe that treating someone on our team as an individual is better than applying a cookie cutter management style to someone's personality.\n\nOur goal is to provide an exceptional work environment so our people can give our customers great customer service.\n\nWe're Proud Because...\n\nWe're one of the largest recruiters of college students in North America each year.\n• Our people develop some sweet skills while selling Cutco, and they build a resume that can take them anywhere.\n• Our people think it's pretty cool to give back.\n• Our people are diverse.\n\nIf you're willing to work hard, have an open mind and a great attitude, we might be a good fit for you!\n\nHow We Do Business\n\nWe belong to the Direct Selling Association, which is the national trade association for companies who manufacture and distribute goods and services sold directly to consumers. All DSA members follow a strict Code of Ethics.\n\nHere's what that means for you:\n\nWe think that professionalism, integrity, and ethical business practices matter.\n\nFrankly, we think that's the only way to do business.\n\nIf you think you would be a great fit for our sales team, complete the contact form, and a receptionist will send you a text to set up an interview with a manager.",
