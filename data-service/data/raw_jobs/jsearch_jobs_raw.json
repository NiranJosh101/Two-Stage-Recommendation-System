    "job_description": "The Role\n\nAt Charles Tyrwhitt our purpose is to “Make it easy for men to dress well” and we can’t do that without our specialist teams. At this time, we’re on the lookout for a Part Time, Sales Associate who will be working with Lloyd from our Washington D.C. store location.\n\nWhat you will be doing\n\nAs a Sales Associate, you’ll be the heartbeat of the store, delivering exceptional customer service that turns every visit into a memorable shopping experience. You’ll greet customers with a warm welcome, offer expert product advice, and make the checkout process smooth and friendly. We’ll provide you with hands-on training to help you grow your knowledge of menswear styling, measuring, and creating polished looks.\n\nWhat we are looking for\n\nCustomer Service experience is essential, preferably in a premium retail environment. Your personality and enthusiasm, combined with your experience will make you a person who is fun to work with, taking pride in appearance, and always with a driven, can-do attitude. Full training is provided to help you understand our brand, product, and customer.\n\nWhat you can expect from us\n\nCT is a privately-owned business, so we're not a big corporate-style place to work. Our senior leaders are transparent and approachable, and we welcome ideas to make this a great place to work. We value our people whilst being product and customer obsessed. We offer excellent benefits while working here, these include:\n• Quarterly bonus based on team sales performance\n• Uniform allowance from day one - from top to toe in Charles Tyrwhitt!\n• Part-time paid time off\n• PayActiv partnership: get wages already earned before payday!\n• Employee Assistance Program\n• This role requires work authorization to work in person within the United States*\n• As required by law, this role can reasonably be expected to pay a base salary to the successful candidate anywhere between $17.95 - $20.00 per hour. This is dependent upon experience related to the role*\n\nWho we are\n\nOnce upon a shirt, Nicholas Charles Tyrwhitt Wheeler had the notion that he could make a better shirt at better value than anyone else in the world! He believed that all men; no matter their shape or size, where they may be in the world or indeed their budget; should be able to own a Jermyn Street quality shirt. A proper shirt. A CT shirt.\n\nThat was over 3 decades ago and whilst Charles Tyrwhitt (it rhymes with spirit by the way) is still famous for proper shirts, these days we are about so much more than collars and cuffs. Our purpose is to “make it easy for men to dress well”. We take care of the entire wardrobe, providing stylish solutions for every occasion. We make sure he gets what he wants, when and how he wants it.\n\nCharles Tyrwhitt’s spiritual home and flagship store is located on London’s Jermyn Street, in the United Kingdom where our presence is well known. We also have a strong online presence in the US, with retail stores in 7 states and a New York head office. We also operate across Europe and Australia! Pretty impressive, eh? And as of 2022, we're proud to be recognized as a carbon-neutral retailer as we continue our journey to be a sustainable business.\n\nLearn more about us at https://www.charlestyrwhitt.careers/\n\n‘I am Proud and Free to be me!’\n\nTyrwhitteers (our people) are a diverse, passionate and entrepreneurial group. We enjoy a fun, engaging and rewarding culture, where everyone is empowered by our 3 BE-liefs which are; “BE the BOSS”, “BE the CUSTOMER” and “BE the BEST”. We want colleagues to love working for CT and for it to feel like a place where they can be, and want to be, themselves.",
